# Portfolio Website

First iteration of my personal website.

Developed alongside [The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) by Angela Yu.

Right now it only uses HTML and CSS. But I may burn it all down later to make room for the new things I've been learning - JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, APIs, and Databases.

*How I'll fit all that in..?*

I may just use Bootstrap and other frameworks for the CSS next time...
