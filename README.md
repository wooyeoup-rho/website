# Portfolio Website

First iteration of my personal website.

Developed alongside [The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) by Angela Yu.

Right now it only uses HTML and CSS. But I may burn it all down later to make room for the new things I've been learning - JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, APIs, and Databases.

Second iteration: https://wooyeoup-rho.vercel.app/

Skeleton of a re-design. Utilizes React to make the inner structure much simpler.
