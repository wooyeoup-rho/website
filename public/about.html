    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr/>

    <p>Hi, I'm Wooyeoup Rho.
    <br/>
    I have a Bachelor's in Medicinal Chemistry and Computer Science (two separate degrees) from the University of New Brunswick.
    </p>

    <p>This portfolio webpage was developed as a part of "The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp" course taught by Angela Yu at Udemy.
    <br/>
    I'm taking this course because:
    <ol>
    <li>It's something I am interested in.</li>
    <li>To improve my skillset.</li>
    <li>Udemy had like a 80% off deal, so I was practically losing money if I didn't buy anything.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <p>Career-wise, I'm interested in exploring development and cybersecurity, or continuing to explore QA (which I spent the bulk of my Co-Op internships doing).</p>
